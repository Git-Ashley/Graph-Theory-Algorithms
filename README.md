# Graph-Theory-Algorithms
# This software demonstrates the Auslander-Parter algorithm. Users can draw their own graphs or select from demo graphs.
# Java SE 8 (1.8) is required to run.

The algorithms' implementation can be found in `src/Algorithms/AuslanderParter.java`.
See chapter 4 of my dissertation for the theory behind the algorithm: https://github.com/Nodeocrat/client/blob/redux/Auslander-Parter.pdf 

Please note this was created before I was a software developer so the coding style might be a little questionable...
